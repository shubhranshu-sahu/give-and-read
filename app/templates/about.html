            Hello! I'm Shubhranshu Sahu, a passionate B.Tech student with a strong interest in web development, AI/ML, and building tech-driven solutions for real-world problems. I enjoy working on impactful projects — one of which is <strong>"Give & Read"</strong>, a platform that helps students access affordable educational resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I’m exploring data-driven approaches to solve environmental issues, including AI-based models to estimate air pollution using satellite data. I’m also learning how to build full-stack web applications using Flask, MySQL, Firebase, and React.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm always open to learning new technologies and collaborating on meaningful projects. Let's connect and create something valuable!
          </p>

          Give & Read is an online platform designed to make NCERT books accessible to students who need them while
          reducing
          book waste. Many students struggle to afford new books every year, while others have old textbooks sitting
          unused
          at
          home. Give & Read bridges this gap by providing a space where people can donate, sell, or exchange their NCERT
          books. By giving these books a second life, we not only help students save money but also contribute to a more
          sustainable and eco-friendly way of learning.
