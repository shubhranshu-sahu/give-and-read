# 📚 Give & Read

**Give & Read** is a community-driven platform where students can **buy, sell, or donate old NCERT books** to help others and reduce educational waste. Built with simplicity in mind, it connects people who want to give away books with those who need them — **for free or at low cost**.

---

## 🌟 Why I Built This

In India, especially in smaller cities like **Indore**, students often struggle to find affordable study materials. Meanwhile, many old books sit unused on shelves.

> ✨ I created **Give & Read** to:
- Reduce the waste of valuable educational resources
- Help students who cannot afford new books
- Encourage a culture of sharing and sustainability

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Auth**: 
- **Hosting**: (To be decided — e.g., Render, Replit, etc.)

## 🌐 How It Works

1. **User visits homepage** and selects:
   - 🔵 Buy a Book
   - 🟢 Sell a Book
   - ⚪ Donate a Book

2. **User logs in** via Firebase Auth to post or request listings.

3. Listings are stored in a **MySQL database** via Flask backend.

4. Other users can view these listings and **contact the lister directly** (e.g., by phone or email — no in-app messaging yet).

5. No shipping is handled — **users meet locally** to exchange books.
